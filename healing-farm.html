        <h2>Healing Farm & Early Childhood Rescue (Kenya)</h2>
        <p class="lead-text">Impactway’s Healing Farm is a specialized rescue, healing, and early development center for Kenya’s most vulnerable street children, ages 0–10. We replace fear and instability with trust, routine, and unconditional care.</p>
        
        <article class="healing-farm">
            <h3>Impact: Restoring Emotional Security and Stability</h3>
            <p>The earliest years are critical. Our trauma-informed program is designed for deep psychological healing, giving children the cognitive scaffolding necessary to transition successfully into primary school (a key indicator of long-term success).</p>
            
            <ul class="impact-list">
                <li>**Emotional Transformation:** Trauma-informed counseling combined with daily interaction (animal care, gardening) is proven to increase emotional regulation in traumatized children within six months.</li>
                <li>**Cognitive Readiness:** Phase 3 focuses on early literacy and cooperative play, preparing children for formal education.</li>
                <li>**Verifiable Outcome (M&E):** We track metrics like **Weight Gain**, **Improved Sleep Quality**, **Reduced Hypervigilance**, and **Attachment to Caregivers** (measured by a registered therapist) to confirm emotional stabilization.</li>
            </ul>
