        <h2>Healing Farm & Early Childhood Rescue (Kenya)</h2>
        <p class="lead-text">Impactway’s Healing Farm is a specialized rescue, healing, and early development center for Kenya’s most vulnerable street children, ages 4–10. We replace fear and instability with trust, routine, and unconditional care.</p>
        
        <article class="healing-farm">
            <h3>Impact: Restoring Emotional Security and Stability</h3>
            <p>Our trauma-informed program is designed for deep psychological healing, giving children the cognitive scaffolding necessary to thrive. We focus on nature-based recovery to improve emotional regulation and attachment.</p>
            
            <ul class="impact-list">
                <li>**Nature-Based Recovery:** Children exposed to natural routines, farm care, and predictable rhythms show reduced hypervigilance and improved emotional regulation.</li>
                <li>**Cognitive Readiness:** Early literacy, cooperative play, and emotional literacy prepare children for successful transition to primary school.</li>
                <li>**Verifiable Outcome (M&E):** We track **Growth (weight/height)**, **Emotional Regulation Markers**, and **Attachment Behaviors** (assessed by a registered therapist) to confirm stabilization.</li>
            </ul>
