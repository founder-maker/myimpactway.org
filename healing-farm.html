        <h2>Healing Farm & Early Childhood Rescue (Kenya)</h2>
        <p class="lead-text">The Impactway Children's Initiative Healing Farm is a specialized rescue center for Kenya’s most vulnerable street children, ages **4–10**. We replace fear and instability with trust, routine, and unconditional care.</p>
        
        <article class="healing-farm">
            <h3>Impact: Restoring Emotional Security</h3>
            <p>Our trauma-informed program is designed for deep psychological healing, giving children the cognitive scaffolding necessary to thrive.</p>
            
            <ul class="impact-list">
                <li>**Nature-Based Recovery:** Children exposed to natural routines, farm care, and predictable rhythms show reduced hypervigilance.</li>
                <li>**Cognitive Readiness:** Early literacy and cooperative play prepare children for transition to primary school.</li>
                <li>**Verifiable Outcome (M&E):** We track Growth (weight/height), Emotional Regulation, and Attachment Behaviors.</li>
            </ul>
